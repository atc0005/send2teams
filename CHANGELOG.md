  - all functionality previously provided by that package has been moved into

## [v0.4.6] - 2020-08-21

### Added

- Docker-based GitHub Actions Workflows
  - Replace native GitHub Actions with containers created and managed through
    the `atc0005/go-ci` project.

  - New, primary workflow
    - with parallel linting, testing and building tasks
    - with three Go environments
      - "old stable"
      - "stable"
      - "unstable"
    - Makefile is *not* used in this workflow
    - staticcheck linting using latest stable version provided by the
      `atc0005/go-ci` containers

  - Separate Makefile-based linting and building workflow
    - intended to help ensure that local Makefile-based builds that are
      referenced in project README files continue to work as advertised until
      a better local tool can be discovered/explored further
    - use `golang:latest` container to allow for Makefile-based linting
      tooling installation testing since the `atc0005/go-ci` project provides
      containers with those tools already pre-installed
      - linting tasks use container-provided `golangci-lint` config file
        *except* for the Makefile-driven linting task which continues to use
        the repo-provided copy of the `golangci-lint` configuration file

  - Add Quick Validation workflow
    - run on every push, everything else on pull request updates
    - linting via `golangci-lint` only
    - testing
    - no builds

### Changed

- Disable `golangci-lint` default exclusions

- dependencies
  - `go.mod` Go version
    - updated from `1.13` to `1.14`
  - `actions/setup-go`
    - updated from `v2.1.0` to `v2.1.2`
      - since replaced with Docker containers
  - `actions/setup-node`
    - updated from `v2.1.0` to `v2.1.1`
  - `actions/checkout`
    - updated from `v2.3.1` to `v2.3.2`

- README
  - Link badges to applicable GitHub Actions workflows results

- Linting
  - Local
    - `Makefile`
      - install latest stable `golangci-lint` binary instead of using a fixed
          version
  - CI
    - remove repo-provided copy of `golangci-lint` config file at start of
      linting task in order to force use of Docker container-provided config
      file

## [v0.4.5] - 2020-07-17

  - `actions/setup-node`
    - updated from `v1` to `v2.1.0`

## [v0.4.2] - 2020-04-25

- Install specific binary version of golangci-lint instead of building from
  `master`

### Fixed

- Makefile: Linting commands do not exclude vendor subfolder

## [v0.4.1] - 2020-04-22

### Changed

- message trailer now includes RFC3339 formatted datestamp for troubleshooting
  purposes

## [v0.4.0] - 2020-04-19

### Added

  atc0005/go-teams-notify@55cca556e7267ec69dc41180591bf666b12321f5
  - provides new `API.SendWithContext()` method

- `teams` subpackage `SendMessage()` now accepts a context and uses it to
  instrument the new `API.SendWithContext()` method

- Add default `TeamsSubmissionTimeout` to mirror original
  `dasrick/go-teams-notify` v1 http client timeout

### Changed

## [v0.3.1] - 2020-04-18

- Update bundled `atc0005/go-teams-notify` fork to reflect inclusion of commit
  943cdeb90f3e53d1ead03bcc1f86cb5de9b4f264

## [v0.3.0] - 2020-04-10

### Added

- Add configurable message submission retry and retry delay flag with default
  setting of two retries, two seconds apart
- `golangci-lint` config file created with current linters + `scopelint`
  linter enabled

### Changed

- `config` subpackage moved into `internal` subdirectory to make it private to
  this project
- `send2teams` app moved into `cmd` subdirectory structure

### Fixed

- Restore version embedding broken in v0.2.5
- Bump copyright year

## [v0.2.5] - 2020-04-09

### Added

- `teams` subpackage
  - intentionally exported for external use
  - the goal is to have as much of the code accepted into the
    `dasrick/go-teams-notify` project as is feasible, and maintain the
    remaining content and anything new related to Microsoft Teams for shared
    use in other projects I work with.
- `config` subpackage
  - will probably move it into an `internal` package structure at some point
    once I read more about it as it is intended only for this project to use
- `README`
  - add brief coverage of new `teams` package
  - add brief coverage of known valid webhook URL FQDNs and provided examples
    of complete webhook URLs using each of the known FQDNs

### Changed

- Using [vendoring](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories)
  - created top-level `vendor` directory using `go mod vendor`
  - locked-in specific commit from the prototype
    `test-extended-messagecard-type` branch from the `atc0005/go-teams-notify`
    fork in order to provide the required functionality used by recent changes
    to this project
  - updated GitHub Actions Workflow to specify `-mod=vendor` build flag for
    all `go` commands that I know of that respect the flag
  - updated GitHub Actions Workflow to exclude `vendor` directory from
    Markdown file linting to prevent potential linting issues in vendored
    dependencies from affecting our CI checks
  - updated `Makefile` to use `-mod=vendor` where applicable
  - updated `go vet` linting check to use `-mod=vendor`

- Updated dependencies
  - `gopkg.in/yaml.v2`
    - `v2.2.4` to `v2.28`
  - `atc0005/go-teams-notify`
    - see note above

### Fixed

- `ConvertEOLToBreak()` function updated to properly handle literal embedded
  newlines as well as the matching escape sequence

## [v0.2.4] - 2020-03-26

### Changed

- As with the `atc0005/send2teams` v0.2.3 release, this release still
  references our fork for now
  - further changes are being developed on our fork for potential inclusion
    upstream

### Fixed

- Update go.mod to use v1.3.0 of `dasrick/go-teams-notify` package
  - changes temporarily provided by our fork as noted in the
    v0.2.3 release notes have been merged upstream

## [v0.2.3] - 2020-03-25

### Changed

- Switch from upstream `dasrick/go-teams-notify` package to our fork,
  `atc0005/go-teams-notify` (intended to be temporary) in order to allow both
  valid webhook URL FQDNs
  - upstream currently only allows the (apparently) more common
    outlook.office.com FQDN
  - an issue has been filed with upstream to extend the `isValidWebhookURL()`
    validation function so that a fork is not necessary

### Fixed

- Update webhook URL validation checks
  - allow either of the known valid webhook URL FQDNs
    - outlook.office.com
    - outlook.office365.com
  - webhook URL length check to fail early with (hopefully) a useful error
    message
  - full regex pattern check in an effort to help catch poorly formatted
    webhook URLs

## [v0.2.2] - 2020-03-23

### Added

- GitHub Actions Workflow
  - print Go version used
    - intended as a future troubleshooting aid

### Fixed

- README
  - formatting for flags table
- Code
  - "slice bounds out of range" panic due to incorrect validity check against
    webhook URL pattern
- GitHub Actions Workflow
  - use current Go versions
    - remove Go v1.12
    - add Go v1.14

## [v0.2.1] - 2019-12-19

### Fixed

- Add missing flag in help output
- Remove forced line break/wrapping since GoDoc interprets
  this as a code block instead of continuing the line

## [v0.2.0] - 2019-12-19

### Added

- Optional conversion of messages with Windows, Mac or Linux newlines to
  `<br>` to increase compatibility with Teams formatting

## [v0.1.0] - 2019-12-18

### Added

This initial prototype supports/provides:

- Command-line flags support via `flag` standard library package
- Go modules (vs classic `GOPATH` setup)
- GitHub Actions linting and build checks
- Makefile for general use cases
