## Project home

See [our GitHub repo][repo-url] for the latest code, to file an issue or
submit improvements for review and potential inclusion into the project.

## Overview

First of all, many thanks to the developer/contributors of the original
`dasrick/go-teams-notify` package. While this project now uses a fork of that
original project, this project would likely not have been possible without the
efforts of the original developer.

This project provides:

- `send2teams`
  - Small CLI tool used to submit messages to Microsoft Teams. `send2teams` is
    intended for use by Nagios, scripts or other actions that may need to submit
    pass/fail results to a MS Teams channel.

Prior to `v0.4.7`, this project also provided a `teams` subpackage. All of
that functionality has since been migrated to the `atc0005/go-teams-notify`
project. All client code for that package has been updated to use
`atc0005/go-teams-notify` in place of the previous `teams` subpackage of this
project.

## Features

- single binary, no outside dependencies
- minimal configuration
- very few build dependencies
- optional conversion of messages with Windows, Mac or Linux newlines to
  `<br>` to increase compatibility with Teams formatting
- message delivery retry support with retry and retry delay values
  configurable via flag
- optional branding of delivered messages
  - noting this application as the delivery agent
  - (also optional) noting a sending application as the source of the message
- optional support for specifying target `url`, `description` comma-separated
  pairs for use as labelled "buttons" within a Microsoft Teams message.

## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Requirements

The following is a loose guideline. Other combinations of Go and operating
systems for building and running tools from this repo may work, but have not
been tested.

### Building source code

- Go
  - see this project's `go.mod` file for *preferred* version
  - this project tests against [officially supported Go
    releases][go-supported-releases]
    - the most recent stable release (aka, "stable")
    - the prior, but still supported release (aka, "oldstable")
- GCC
  - if building with custom options (as the provided `Makefile` does)
- `make`
  - if using the provided `Makefile`

### Running

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu Linux 18.04+

## How to install it

### From source

1. [Download][go-docs-download] Go
1. [Install][go-docs-install] Go
   - NOTE: Pay special attention to the remarks about `$HOME/.profile`
1. Clone the repo
   1. `cd /tmp`
   1. `git clone https://github.com/atc0005/send2teams`
   1. `cd send2teams`
1. Install dependencies (optional)
   - for Ubuntu Linux
     - `sudo apt-get install make gcc`
   - for CentOS Linux
     1. `sudo yum install make gcc`
1. Build
   - for current operating system
     - `go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/send2teams/`
       - *forces build to use bundled dependencies in top-level `vendor`
         folder*
   - for all supported platforms (where `make` is installed)
      - `make all`
   - for Windows
      - `make windows`
   - for Linux
     - `make linux`
1. Copy the applicable binary to whatever systems needs to run it
   - if using `Makefile`: look in `/tmp/release_assets/send2teams/`
   - if using `go build`: look in `/tmp/send2teams/`

### Using release binaries

1. Download the [latest
   release](https://github.com/atc0005/send2teams/releases/latest) binaries
1. Deploy
   - Place `send2teams` in a location of your choice
     - e.g., `/usr/local/bin/send2teams`

## Configuration Options

### Webhook URLs

#### Expected format

Valid webhook URLs for Microsoft Teams use one of several (confirmed) FQDNs
patterns:

- `outlook.office.com`
- `outlook.office365.com`
- `*.webhook.office.com`
  - e.g., `example.webhook.office.com`

Using a webhook URL with any of these FQDN patterns appears to give identical
results.

Here are complete, equivalent example webhook URLs from Microsoft's
documentation using the FQDNs above:

- <https://outlook.office.com/webhook/a1269812-6d10-44b1-abc5-b84f93580ba0@9e7b80c7-d1eb-4b52-8582-76f921e416d9/IncomingWebhook/3fdd6767bae44ac58e5995547d66a4e4/f332c8d9-3397-4ac5-957b-b8e3fc465a8c>
- <https://outlook.office365.com/webhook/a1269812-6d10-44b1-abc5-b84f93580ba0@9e7b80c7-d1eb-4b52-8582-76f921e416d9/IncomingWebhook/3fdd6767bae44ac58e5995547d66a4e4/f332c8d9-3397-4ac5-957b-b8e3fc465a8c>
- <https://example.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/a1269812-6d10-44b1-abc5-b84f93580ba0@9e7b80c7-d1eb-4b52-8582-76f921e416d9/IncomingWebhook/3fdd6767bae44ac58e5995547d66a4e4/f332c8d9-3397-4ac5-957b-b8e3fc465a8c>
  - note the `webhookb2` sub-URI specific to this FQDN pattern

All of these patterns should pass the default validation applied to
user-specified webhook URLs.

#### How to create a webhook URL (Connector)

1. Open Microsoft Teams
1. Navigate to the channel where you wish to receive incoming messages from
   this application
1. Select `â‹¯` next to the channel name and then choose Connectors.
1. Scroll through the list of Connectors to Incoming Webhook, and choose Add.
1. Enter a name for the webhook, upload an image to associate with data from
   the webhook, and choose Create.
1. Copy the webhook URL to the clipboard and save it. You'll need the webhook
   URL for sending information to Microsoft Teams.
   - NOTE: While you can create another easily enough, you should treat this
     webhook URL as sensitive information as anyone with this unique URL is
     able to send messages (without authentication) into the associated
     channel.
1. Choose Done.

## Examples

### One-off

This example illustrates the basics of using the application to submit a
single message. This can serve as a starting point for use with Nagios,
scripts or any other tool that calls out to others in order to perform its
tasks.

The same example, shown split over multiple lines for readability (e.g., shell
script):

```console
./send2teams \
  --silent \
  --channel "Alerts" \
  --team "Support" \
  --message "System XYZ is down!" \
  --title "System outage alert" \
  --sender "Nagios" \
  --color "#832561" \
  --url "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/www@xxx/IncomingWebhook/yyy/zzz"
```

and on a single line (e.g., one-off via terminal or batch file):

```console
./send2teams.exe --silent --channel "Alerts" --team "Support" --message "System XYZ is down!" --title "System outage alert" --sender "Nagios" --color "#832561" --url "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/www@xxx/IncomingWebhook/yyy/zzz"
```

Remove the `-silent` flag in order to see pass or failure output, otherwise
look at the exit code (`$?`) or Microsoft Teams to determine results.

### Using an invalid flag

Accidentally typing the wrong flag results in a message like this one:

```ShellSession
flag provided but not defined: -fake-flag
```

### Specifying url, description pairs

```console
./send2teams \
  --silent \
  --channel "Alerts" \
  --team "Support" \
  --message "Useful starting points" \
  --title "Learn more about Go" \
  --sender "Nagios" \
  --color "#832561" \
  --url "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/www@xxx/IncomingWebhook/yyy/zzz" \
  --target-url "https://www.golang.org/, Go Homepage" \
  --target-url "https://github.com/dariubs/GoBooks, Awesome Go Books"
```

and on a single line (e.g., one-off via terminal or batch file):

```console
./send2teams.exe --silent --channel "Alerts" --team "Support" --message "Useful starting points" --title "Learn more about Go" --sender "Nagios" --color "#832561" --url "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/www@xxx/IncomingWebhook/yyy/zzz" --target-url "https://www.golang.org/, Go Homepage" --target-url "https://github.com/dariubs/GoBooks, Awesome Go Books"
```
